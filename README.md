# Project

This is a sample Survey application demonstrating how to integrate Power Fx low code expressions. 

Surveys are described in Yaml files and can include embedded Power Fx expressions to provide
dynamic functionality like:

- dynamic text for questions and ansers 
- skipping questions based on previous answers
- running a hook on survey complete. 

For more information on Power Fx, see https://github.com/microsoft/Power-Fx
